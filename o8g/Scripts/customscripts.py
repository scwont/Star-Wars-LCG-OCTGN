# This file contains the autoscripting for cards with specialized effects. So called 'CustomScripts'
# * UseCustomAbility() is used among other scripts, and it just one custom ability among other normal core commands
# * CustomScipt() is a completely specialized effect, that is usually so unique, that it's not worth updating my core commands to facilitate it for just one card.
# Remote Functions are custom functions coming from specific cards which usually affect other players and are called via remoteCall()
